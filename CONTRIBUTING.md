## Contributing to this Project
'Wanna geek out? Juicy! You'll get started in a bit :smirk:. Just follow these steps :fire::

1. Fork this repo
2. Open the forked repo in your terminal and run `npm install`
3. Start to watch for changes with `npm start` - this runs a nodemon task and will automatically recompile any changes
4. Open the repo in **VS Code**
5. Launch your command palette <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P</kbd> and type **VSIX**. Select the one that says **Extensions: Install from VSIX...`
6. Load the VSIX file you created a few steps back
7. Set your editor to use this theme - change the name in `package.json` to something like "Material Palenight Dev" so you can differentiate from the one you've installed from the marketplace.
8. Go to the debug sidebar `View â†’ Debug`
9. Press the green arrow beside "Launch Extension"
10. This will then open a second window.
11. Make a change, and then hit the refresh button on your debug toolbar - this is in your first editor - not the one that poped open.
12. Wait a sec, your changes should now be reflected!
13. Commit your changes to your **fork** of this repo
14. Send a **PR** that contains a detailed information about your change
15. I'll review it, and decide whether it should be merged :book:.
16. You're done :wink:!

Thanks for showing interest and helping out :ok_hand:!
